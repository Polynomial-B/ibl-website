	<h2>refresh. smooth. rejuvenate.</h2>
	<p>
		Anti-wrinkle injections designed to reduce the appearance of fine lines and expression wrinkles.
		These lines often form through repeated facial movements - like frowning, squinting, or raising
		your eyebrows and can contribute to a tired or aged appearance.
	</p>
	<p>
		By gently relaxing the underlying muscles, this treatment smooths areas such as the forehead,
		frown lines and the delicate lines that form around the eyes, helping to restore a more
		refreshed, youthful look - all while maintaining your natural facial expressions.

	<h2>ABOUT THE TREATMENT</h2>
	<p>
		At Inside Beauty London, every anti-wrinkle treatment is entirely bespoke, designed around your
		facial anatomy, your concerns and the results you’re hoping to achieve.
	</p>
	<p>
		During your consultation, I’ll take the time to understand your goals and assess your features,
		so that we can create a treatment plan that feels right for you. Doses and treatment areas are
		precisely measured to maintain natural facial movement, while softening the signs of ageing.
	</p>
	<p>
		With advanced aesthetic training and a deep understanding of facial harmony, my focus is always
		on enhancing what’s already there — never overdone, always refined. The aim is to leave you
		looking smooth, rested, and effortlessly confident.

<Faq
	prep="Before your procedure, it’s essential to follow a few simple steps to ensure the best possible results. Avoid blood-thinning or anti-inflammatory medications, alcohol, and supplements like aspirin or fish oil at least 24 hours prior to your treatment to minimise bruising. Arriving at your appointment with clean skin, well-rested and hydrated will also help your skin respond better to the anti-wrinkle injections."
	post="After the procedure, avoid touching or massaging the treated areas and keep your head upright for at least 4 hours to prevent the product from migrating. Refrain from strenuous exercise, bending, lifting, facials, or face-down massages for 24 hours. Avoid makeup for 4 hours, and when reapplying, use clean brushes or sponges. Mild bumps or welts at the injection site are normal-avoid touching them. Gentle facial movements can help the product settle and absorb effectively."
	results="You may start to notice subtle changes within 3–5 days, but full results typically develop around 10–14 days after treatment. In some cases, a top-up may be required to achieve the desired result. Everyone’s response to Botox is slightly different, as factors such as individual muscle activity and how quickly your body metabolises the product can affect how soon you see results and how long they last."
