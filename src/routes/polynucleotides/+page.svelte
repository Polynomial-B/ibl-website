	<h2>WHAT IS IT?</h2>
	<p>
		Polynucleotides are a cutting-edge, non-filler injectable treatment that regenerate the skin at
		a cellular level. Unlike traditional skin boosters or dermal fillers, polynucleotides don’t just
		hydrate or volumise- they actively repair, restore, and stimulate the production of collagen and
		regenerate your skin’s natural building blocks.
	</p>
	<p>
		Derived from highly purified DNA fragments (typically sourced from salmon), you may have heard
		this treatment nicknamed the “salmon sperm facial” — a reference to its marine origin and
		remarkable skin-regenerating properties. Polynucleotides work by improving skin quality from
		within, targeting concerns such as dullness, fine lines, under-eye hollows, acne scarring, and
		loss of firmness. Their unique regenerative action makes them ideal for anyone seeking a more
		natural, long-term solution to ageing or tired skin.

	<h2>ABOUT THE TREATMENT</h2>
	<p>
		Polynucleotide treatments at Inside Beauty London are designed for those who want to improve
		their skin’s health, structure, and resilience — without adding volume or risking an overfilled
		look.
	</p>
	<p>
		After a detailed consultation, the treatment involves a series of precise injections using a
		fine needle, often focused on areas such as the under-eyes, cheeks, neck or chest. It’s a
		convenient, low-downtime procedure, with minor swelling or small bumps that generally settle
		within a few days.
	</p>
	<p>
		There’s no instant plumping or risk of lumpiness- instead, you’ll notice firmer, brighter,
		smoother skin that improves over time. For many, it’s the treatment they didn’t know they
		needed: subtle, science-led, and transformative in all the right ways.

	prep="Avoid alcohol and blood-thinning medications or supplements (like aspirin, ibuprofen, or vitamin E) for 24–48 hours beforehand to minimise the risk of bruising. Arrive with clean skin and no makeup."
	post="Avoid touching the treated area for the first few hours. You may notice small bumps or mild redness at the injection sites - this is normal and usually subsides within a couple of days. Avoid makeup for 12 hours, and hold off on exercise, saunas, or sunbeds for 24–48 hours."
	results="Results develop gradually over 4–6 weeks as your skin begins to regenerate at a deeper level. Unlike fillers, there’s no instant volume or plumpness, but also no risk of overfilling. Most clients require three sessions, 3 weeks apart, to achieve optimal results, with maintenance sessions every 6 months. Expect smoother texture, improved elasticity, and a refreshed, firmer-looking complexion that keeps getting better over time."
