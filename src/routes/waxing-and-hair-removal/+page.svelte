	<h2>hair-free. care-free.</h2>
	<p>
		Waxing is a semi-permanent hair removal method that lifts hair from the root, leaving your skin
		smoother for weeks.
	</p>
	<p>
		At Inside Beauty London, I use Lycon So Berry Wax; a high-performance, ultra-fine wax infused
		with aromatherapy oils and micro-mica. It grips hair as short as 2 mm, leaves no sticky residue,
		and creates a silky, fast-drying finish with zero drag, softness, and a delicious strawberry
		scent.
	</p>

	<h2>ABOUT THE TREATMENT</h2>
	<p>
		Your waxing experience is elevated with Lycon’s gentle formula that adheres only to hair—not
		skin. This means less irritation, virtually no redness, and no ingrown hairs.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each session is fast, hygienic and highly effective. Expect long-lasting smoothness (typically
		4–6 weeks before you notice regrowth) and finer, softer hair over time. I offer waxing for a
		full range of areas — from larger areas such as legs, arms, underarms, and Hollywood/Brazilian;
		to smaller, more delicate areas including the face, lip, chin, and nose.

	prep="Ensure the area is clean, dry, and free from lotions or oils. If you normally shave, leave at least 2 weeks before having a waxing treatment to allow the hair to grow long enough for effective removal. If you have sensitive skin or it’s your first wax, please let me know ahead of your appointment."
	post="After the procedure, avoid touching or massaging the treated areas and keep your head upright for at least 4 hours to prevent the product from migrating. Refrain from strenuous exercise, bending, lifting, facials, or face-down massages for 24 hours. Avoid makeup for 4 hours, and when reapplying, use clean brushes or sponges. Mild bumps or welts at the injection site are normal-avoid touching them. Gentle facial movements can help the product settle and absorb effectively."
	results="Immediately! Enjoy smooth, hair-free skin straight after your appointment. Regrowth usually appears after 4–6 weeks, although on rare occasions some people may notice hair growth sooner — everyone’s hair growth cycle is different. With regular treatments, hair typically becomes finer and softer over time."
