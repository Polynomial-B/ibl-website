	<h2>hydrate & illuminate.</h2>
	<p>
		Skin boosters are injectable treatments that hydrate the skin at a deep level while improving
		elasticity, tone and overall texture. Unlike dermal fillers, they don’t add volume; instead,
		they work by infusing the skin with hyaluronic acid, a moisture-retaining molecule naturally
		found in the body. Think of it as a drink for your skin, working from within to restore radiance
		and suppleness.
	</p>
	<p>
		This treatment is ideal for tired, dehydrated, or ageing skin and can be used on the face, neck
		and décolletage. At Inside Beauty London, I use trusted brands like Profhilo to deliver a
		natural glow and boost collagen production from within; leaving the skin looking smoother,
		firmer and more radiant over time.

	<h2>ABOUT THE TREATMENT</h2>
	<p>
		Skin booster treatments are tailored to support your skin’s health, glow and long-term
		resilience. After a full consultation, a series of injections are placed just beneath the
		surface of the skin using a fine needle; the procedure is quick, with only mild discomfort.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may notice small, raised areas known as ‘blebs’, along with some redness or swelling at the
		injection sites- this is completely normal and usually settles within 24–72 hours. While a
		single session can improve hydration, optimal results typically come from a course of 2–3
		treatments spaced 4 weeks apart, followed by maintenance sessions every 4–6 months.
	</p>
	<p>
		This treatment is ideal for anyone looking to smooth fine lines, improve skin tone, and achieve
		a fresher, more luminous complexion- without adding volume or altering facial structure.

	prep="Avoid alcohol and blood-thinning medications or supplements (like aspirin, ibuprofen, or vitamin E) for 24–48 hours beforehand to minimise the risk of bruising. Arrive with clean skin and no makeup."
	post="Avoid touching the treated area for the first few hours. You may notice small bumps or mild redness at the injection sites — this is normal and usually subsides within a couple of days. Avoid makeup for 12 hours, and hold off on exercise, saunas, or sunbeds for 24–48 hours."
	results="Most clients begin to notice a healthier, more hydrated look within about 1 week, with full results developing over 2–4 weeks as collagen production increases. For the best and longest-lasting results, a course of 3 treatments spaced 4 weeks apart is recommended. With the full course, results can last around 6–8 months before a maintenance session is needed."
